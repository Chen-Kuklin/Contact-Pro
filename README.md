An application used to manage contacts with extensive features.

The application also boasts an intuitive interface, with a screen that displays a list of all the saved contacts. When a user clicks on a contact, they can easily view all the details related to that contact. One of the unique features of this app is that users can enter a contact's address, and when they click on it, the application automatically switches to Waze with the contact's address. This seamless integration makes it easier for users to navigate and find the contact's location.
